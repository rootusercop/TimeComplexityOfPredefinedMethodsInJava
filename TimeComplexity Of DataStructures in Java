Question: Time Comeplexity of different data structures in Java ?
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7294634/what-are-the-time-complexities-of-various-data-structures

Solution:
Arrays
Set, Check element at a particular index: O(1)
Searching: O(n) if array is unsorted and O(log n) if array is sorted and something like a binary search is used,
As pointed out by Aivean, there is no Delete operation available on Arrays. We can symbolically delete an element by setting it to some specific value, e.g. -1, 0, etc. depending on our requirements
Similarly, Insert for arrays is basically Set as mentioned in the beginning

ArrayList:
Add: Amortized O(1)
Remove: O(n)
Contains: O(n)
Size: O(1)

Linked List:
Inserting: O(1), if done at the head, O(n) if anywhere else since we have to reach that position by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.
Deleting: O(1), if done at the head, O(n) if anywhere else since we have to reach that position by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.
Searching: O(n)

Doubly-Linked List:
Inserting: O(1), if done at the head or tail, O(n) if anywhere else since we have to reach that position by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.
Deleting: O(1), if done at the head or tail, O(n) if anywhere else since we have to reach that position by traveseing the linkedlist linearly.
Searching: O(n)

Stack:
Push: O(1)
Pop: O(1)
Top: O(1)
Search (Something like lookup, as a special operation): O(n) (I guess so)

Queue/Deque/Circular Queue:
Insert: O(1)
Remove: O(1)
Size: O(1)

Binary Search Tree:
Insert, delete and search: Average case: O(log n), Worst Case: O(n)

Red-Black Tree:
Insert, delete and search: Average case: O(log n), Worst Case: O(log n)

Heap/PriorityQueue (min/max):
findMin/findMax: O(1)
insert: O(log n)
deleteMin/Max: O(log n)
lookup, delete (if at all provided): O(n), we will have to scan all the elements as they are not ordered like BST

Java ArrayList time complexity :
Read/Search any element O(n). If you know the index then the complexity is O(1)
Update : O(n)
Delete at beginning: O(n)
Delete in middle: O(n)
Delete at end: O(n)
Add at beginning: O(n)
Add in middle: O(n)
Add at end: O(n)

Linked List time complexity : It has elements linked in one direction so as to provide ordered iteration 
of elements.
Read/Search any element O(n)
Update : O(n)
Delete at beginning: O(1)
Delete in middle: O(n)
Delete at end: O(n)
Add at beginning: O(1)
Add in middle: O(n)
Add at end: O(n)

HashMap time complexity : The elements are placed randomly as per the hashcode. Here the assumption is
that a good implementation of hashcode has been provided.
Read/Search any element O(1)
Update : O(1)
Delete : O(1)
Add : O(1)

LinkedHashMap time complexity : The elements are placed randomly as with HashMap but are linked together
to provide ordered iteration of elements.
Read/Search any element O(1)
Update : O(1)
Delete : O(1)
Add at beginning: O(1)
Add in middle: O(n)
Add at end: O(n)

HashSet time complexity : The elements are distributed randomly in memory using their hashcode. 
Here also the assumption is that good hashcode which generated unique hashcode for different 
objects has been provided.
Read/Search any element O(1)
Update : O(1)
Delete : O(1)
Add : O(1)

LinkedHashSet time complexity : It is same as HashSet with the addition of links between the elements of the Set.
Read/Search any element O(1)
Update : O(1)
Delete : O(1)
Add at beginning: O(1)
Add in middle: O(n)
Add at end: O(n)

TreeMap time complexity : Provides natural sorting of elements. Uses equals, compare and compareTo 
methods to determine the sorting order.
Read/Search any element O(log n)
Update : O(log n)
Delete : O(log n)
Add : O(log n)

TreeSet time complexity : Internally used an instances of TreeMap with the elements as key and a dummy 
value for all entries in the TreeMap.
Read/Search any element O(log n)
Update : O(log n)
Delete : O(log n)
Add : O(log n)
